# Projet_ADA

The idea of this project is to corroborate macroeconomic principles such as the relationship between the idea of relative wealth and spending behaviour.

We showed that the evolution of inflation versus household consumption. We calculated the latency in the changes in the dependent trend (household consumption) in response to those in the inflation rate. This shows population's actual behaviour versus what macroeconomic principles predict.

Classical economic theory relies on the idea that all agents on the market behave rationally which is not always the case. Our project provides a tool for users to find instances where irrational behaviour of people diverge the real economical situation from predicted by traditional (i.e. Keynesian) economic theories.  

For example, when looking at countries with high unemployment rate, classical economic theory stipulates that high unemployment should lower inflation in reaction to shrinking consumption or that low unemployment should make wages rise rapidly in reaction to tight labor market, as illustrated by the Phillips curve, but behavioral macroeconomics ("Behavioral Macroeconomics and Macroeconomic Behavior" by
George A. Akerlof) shows that it is not happening, people don't take rational decisions to change salary or consumption expectations based on economical situation. At the same time, the richer population is, less rules apply to their spending and saving habits. Rich are getting richer - they are less affected by financial crises, they bounce back to prosperity quicker; volatile markets have less effect on savings for retirement ("third pillar") and excessive consumption of the rich than on the poor. 

We welcome users to try and find other discrepancies with our tool using a Bokeh Server.
